EER Model
	subclasses and superclasses
	Specialization and generalization
	category or union types

Specialization
	process of defining a set of subclasses of an entity type
	Defined on the basis of some distinguishing charactersitic the entites in the superclass
		a superclass can have more than one subclass based on different criteria

	Subclass can define
		Specific (local) attributes
			-pay_scale attribute is specific to hourly employee subclass
		Specific relationship types
			-hourly employee sublcass participates in belongs_to relationship

in disjoint relationships a entity must only belong to one subgroup. 
certain attributes may only belong to a subclass
	- employee secretary may have  typing speed
		while a engineer may habe eng_type

Generalizations
	decide which attributes belong to subclass vs superclass
Disjointness
	specifies the sublcasses must be disjoint
	indicated by a d symbol in inside the specialization sircle
Completeness
	total specialization, Every entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass
	partial specialization
		allows an entity not belong to any of the subclass

hierarchy
	every sublcass participates as a subclass in only one relationship
	single inheratince

lattice
	every subclass participates as a subclass in multiple relationships
